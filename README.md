# DDOS_Attack_Detection
#### Summary:
###### Deep Learning-based approaches (Convolutional Neural Networks and variants of Recurrent Neural Networks, namely Long Short-Term Memory, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Stacked Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Units) were used to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in this paper.DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal flow of a target server, service, or network. These attacks are effective using multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic.AI systems are used to solve complex tasks just like humans solve Problems.The data is pre-processed before being fed into Deep Learning techniques. The preprocessed dataset is used to train and test Deep Learning techniques. The reported results reveal that the RNN (Artificial Neural Network)-based Stacked-LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) Deep Learning technique outperforms existing Deep Learning-based algorithms in identifying DDoS attacks.
